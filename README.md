# Technique Inference Engine

The Technique Inference Engine (TIE) allows cyber defenders to forecast an adversary's
next steps by predicting associated [MITRE ATT&CK](<(https://attack.mitre.org/)>)
techniques from previously observed techniques. TIE enables defenders to build a
complete picture of an adversary and their actions. TIE also offers one of the largest
publicly available datasets of its kind, linking CTI Reports to ATT&CK Techniques. The
dataset includes 43,899 technique observations across 6,236 CTI Reports, achieving 96%
coverage of ATT&CK Enterprise v15.0. This project is created and maintained by the
[MITRE Center for Threat-Informed
Defense](https://ctid.mitre.org/)
in furtherance of our mission to advance the start of the art and the state of the
practice in threat-informed defense globally. The project is funded by our research
participants.

## Getting Started

To get started, we suggest visiting the project website, reading about the project, and
experimenting with the Engine. For machine learning engineers, you may want to try
training your own models using the Python notebook and/or training data.

| [Technique Inference Engine (Website)](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/technique-inference-engine/)                    | Learn about the project and run TIE right in your browser.                   |
| [Technique Inference Engine (Python Notebook)](https://center-for-threat-informed-defense.github.io/technique-inference-engine/#/resources) | Run TIE locally and modify the code or training data to build custom models. |
| [Training Data](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/technique-inference-engine/tree/main/data)                            | Access the CTI Data used to train TIE.                                       |

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Visit the Technique Inference Engine website.** Use the website to learn how the Engine works and make your own predictions.
- **Train your own Engine.** Train the Technique Inference Engine on your own CTI data using the official Python Notebook.
- **Contribute your own CTI.** We are interested in further expanding the Engine's dataset. If you have your own CTI you'd like to share, we would welcome your contribution.
